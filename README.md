## What is the .eth Website Competition?
The .eth websites competition (aka "The competition") is a monthly competition among new created .eth websites.
Our mission is to grow the .eth website community and promote awareness around .eth websites.



## Competition Prizes
Not including fame and a place in the history books, the winner will also receive:
1. 100 $ENS awarded by the ENS Ecosystem Working Group.
2. Promotion on the [esteroids.eth](https://esteroids.eth.limo) website and social media accounts until the end of the month.
3. Your .eth website announced publicly as the winner on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/e_steroids), [Discord](https://discord.gg/9c2EWzjFzY), and on the ENS Discourse forum.

## Candidate Vote
Since there are so many new .eth websites (yay!), we believe that the initial vote should be from a wide list of newly created .eth websites in the last month.

* Voting will be done via [snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org/#/); Each .eth name owner will be able to vote only once, and each wallet address will be able to vote only once (even if one wallet owns multiple .eth names)
* Candidates List will be announced in the following places: 
    1. [Esteroids](https://esteroids.eth.limo) dedicated contest page
    2. [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) dedicated page
    3. ENS Discourse [thread post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/eth-websites-subgroup-q1-q2-2022/11441) and ENS discord (#general channel).
    4. Discord dedicated channel for Esteroids (#eth-website-subgroup).


## Final Nominees Vote
The final four websites selected as nominees will be published in a Twitter poll on the Esteroids page to allow bigger audience participation.



## Which .eth Websites Can Participate?
The competition is for newly created .eth websites during the previous month.
Since there are so many new .eth websites created (more than 250), we will create an initial "Candidate list" for voting, which will only include:


1. .eth decentralized websites not redirecting or pulling most of the data from centralized sources.
2. Newly created (.eth name and content).
3. No empty placeholder or "hello world" websites.

Please share any feedback you may have on our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/9c2EWzjFzY).
