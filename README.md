## Candidates list voting
Since there are so many new .eth websites (yay!) We think that initial voting should be from a wide list of newly created .eth websites in the previous month.

* Voting will be done via snapshot.org space, each .eth name owner will be able to vote once and each address will be able to vote only once (even if same address owns multiple names)
* Candidates List will be announced in a few places: 
    1. [Esteroids](https://esteroids.eth.limo) dedicated contest page.
    2. [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) dedicated space 
    3. ENS Discourse thread post and ENS discord (#general channel).
    4. Discord dedicated channel Esteroids (#eth-website-subgroup).


## Final nominees voting 
The 4 final nominated websites will be published on a twitter poll on Esteroids page to allow bigger audience participation



## Which .eth websites can participate?
The competition is for newly created .eth websites in the previous month.
Since there are so many new .eth websites created (more than 250),we will create an initial "Candidate list" for voting.


1. .eth decentralized websites not redirecting or pulling most of the data from none decentralized sources
2. Newly created (by name and content)
3. Are not empty shell or "hello world" websites
